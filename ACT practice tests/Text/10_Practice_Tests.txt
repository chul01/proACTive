INTRODUCTION: USING THIS BOOK 
This book contains ten simulated ACT practice tests. You can use these tests as 
"dress rehearsals" to get you ready for the whole experience of taking an ACT 
exam. 
If you have enough time between now and your ACT (at least three weeks 
but preferably twelve to eighteen weeks), you should work through this entire 
book. If you have only a few days, try to complete as many practice tests as time 
allows. Even just a few hours of study and practice can have a beneficial impact 
on your ACT score. 
Use this book as a companion to McGraw-Hill's ACT prep book. 
HOW TO USE THE PRACTICE TESTS 
Each practice test in this book is a full-length simulated ACT. Written by ACT 
experts, these tests are designed to be as close as you can get to the actual 
exam. The tests contain some variations in style and mix of question type. This 
approach is intentional so that you can get a taste Of all Of the various formats and 
styles that can appear on an ACT exam. If you work thmugh all of the material 
provided, you can rest assured that there won't be any surprises on test day. 
However, you should keep your score results in perspective. Generally, students 
tend to score slightly higher on each successive practice test. But the truth is 
that ACT exams are sensitive to factors such as fatigue and Stress. The time Of 
the day that you take the exams, your surroundings, and other things going on 
in your life can have an impact on your scores. Don't get worried if you see some 
variations due to an off day or because the practice test exposed a weakness in 
your knowledge base or skill set. Just use the information that you gather as a 
tool to help you improve. 
Them is an explanation for each of the practice questions in this book. You 
will probably not need to read absolutely all of them. Sometimes you can tell 
right away why you got a particular question wrong. We have seen countless 
students smack themselves on the rorehead and say "stupid mistake. " We try to 
refer to these errors as "concentration errors." Everyone makes them from time 
to time, and you should not worry when they occur. Them is a good chance 
that your focus Will be a little better on the real test as long as you train your- 
self properly with the aid of this book. You should distinguish between those 
concentration errors and any understanding issues or holes in your knowledge 
base. If you have the time, it is worth reading the explanations for any of the 
questions that were at all challenging for you. Sometimes, students get questions 
correct but for the wrong reason, or because they guessed correctly. While you 
are practicing, you should mark any questions that you want to revisit and be 
sure to read the explanations for those questions. 
A NOTE ON SCORING THE PRACTICE TESTS 
The tests in this book are simulations created by experts to replicate the ques- 
lion types, difficulty level, and content areas that you will find on your real 
ACT. The Scoring Worksheets provided for each test are guides to computing 
Copyright @ 2008 by The McGraw-HI' Companies, Inc. CW here for terms of use. 

****** Result for Image/Page 12 ******
INTRODUCTION: USING THIS BOOK 
approximate scores. Actual ACT exams are scored from tables that are unique to 
each tesL The actual scaled scores depend on a number of factors, which include 
the number of students who take the test, the difficulty level of the items, (ques- 
Lions and answer choices), and the performance of all of the students who take 
the test. This means that "your mileage may vary." Do not get too hung up on 
your test scores; the idea is to learn something from each practice experience 
and to get used to the "look and feel" of the ACT. 
Each Scoring Worksheet has formulas for you to work out an approximate 
scaled score for each section, as well as an overall Composite Score. Each com- 
putation includes a "correction factor," which is an average correction derived 
from analysis of recent ACT exams. The correction factor is most valid for stu- 
dents whose scores are in the middle 50% of all scores. The correction factor 
starts to lose a bit or its effectiveness at the top and bottom or the scoring scale. 
This is not a major flaw in the practice tests; your actual ACT score report will 
include a "band" around each score. ACT, Inc., says right on the student's score 
report that they do this to highlight the fact that all test scores are just estimates.

UNDERSTANDING THE ACT 
WHAT IS THE ACT? 
The authors of the ACT insist that the ACT is an achievement test, meaning that 
it is designed to measure your readiness for college instruction. There is ongoing 
debate about how well the ACT accomplishes that mission. What is not debated 
is that the ACT is not a direct measure of intelligence. It is not an 10 test- The 
ACT is certainly not a measure of your worth as a human being. It is not even a 
perfect measure Of how well you Will do in college. Theoretically, each Of us has 
a specific potential to learn and acquire skills. The ACT doesn't measure your 
natural, inborn ability. If it did, we wouldn't be as successful as we are at raising 
students' scores on ACT exams. 
The ACT actually measures a certain knowledge base and skill set. It is 
"trainable," meaning that you can do better on your ACT if you work on gaining 
the knowledge and acquiring the skills that are tested. 
The ACT is broken up into four multiple-choice tests and one optional essay. 
The multiple-choice tests are called English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science 
Reasoning, respectively. They are always given in the same order. In fact, there 
is a lot of predictability when it comes to the ACT. The current exam still has 
very much in common with ACT exams from past years. This means that we 
basically know what is going to be on your ACT in terms or question types and 
content- The ACT Structure chart on the next page provides more information 
on the format of the ACT. 
ACT offers a thirty-minute Writing Test as an optional component to the 
ACT. Many colleges and universities require applicants to take the Writing Test. 
Be sure to check with your schools of choice prior to registering for the test. 
WHO WRITES THE ACT? 
There is a company called ACT, Inc. that decides exactly what is going to be on 
your ACT exam. This group of experts consults with classroom teacheß at the 
high school and college level. They look at high school and college curricula and 
they employ edueators and specialized psychologists called "psychometricians" 
(measurers or the mind), who know a lot about the human brain and how it 
operates under various conditions. We picture them as "evil genius" researchers 
gleefully rubbing their hands together and trying to think up ways to keep you 
out of college. Don't fear, however; we are the "good geniuses" trying to get you 
into the college of your choice. We'll lay out the details of how you will be tested 
so that you can get yourself ready for the "contest" on test 
REGISTERING FOR THE ACT 
You must register for the ACT in advance. You can't just show up on test day 
with a number 2 pencil and dive right in. The best source of information for all 
things ACT is, not surprisingly, the ACT Web site: www.act.org. There is also 
a very good chance that a guidance counselor and/or pre-college counselor at

WHY DO ACT EXAMS EXIST? 
Back in the mid-twentieth century, some people noticed that there was a disturb- 
ing trend in college admissions. Most of the people who were entering college 
came from a fairly small group of people who went to a limited number of high 
schools. Many had parents who had attended the same colleges. There wasn't 
much opportunity for students fmm new families to "break into" the higher edu 
cation system. Standardized entrance exams were an attempt to democratize the 
situation and create a meritocracy where admissions decisions were based on 
achievement and not just social status. The ACT was not the first standardized 
college entrance exam. It came a little later as an attempt at improving on the 
older SAT. 
Colleges use the ACT for admissions decisions and, sometimes, for advanced 
placement. It is also used to make scholarship decisions. Since there are vari 
ations among high schools around the country, the admissions departments at 
colleges use the ACT, in part, to help provide a standard for comparison. There 
are studies that reveal a fair amount of "grade inflation" at some schools. So, col- 
leges cannot simply rely upon grade point averages when evaluating academic 
performance. 
ACT SCORES 
Each of the multiple-choice sections of the ACT is called a Test. Each test is 
given a score on a scale of 1 to 36. These four "scaled scores" are then averaged 
and rounded according to normal rounding rules to yield a Composite Score. It 
is this Composite Score that is most often meant when someone refers to your 
ACT score. 
Your actual score report Will also refer to "subscores," which are reported 
for your English, Mathematics, and Reading tests. These are based on your 
performance on a subset or the questions on each of these tests. Our experience 
has been that there is nothing to be gained from discussing them in detail with 
students. Reports indicate that many college admissions professionals don't have 
the faintest idea how to utilize them when making admissions decisions. 
One important thing that can be said about scores is that you don't have to 
be perfect to get a good score on the ACT. The truth is that you can miss a [air 
number of questions and still get a score that places you in the top 1 % of all test 
taker* In ract, this test is so hard and the time limit is so unrealistic for most test 
takers that you can get a score that is at the national average (about a 21 ) even if 
you get almost half of the questions wrong. Use the scoring guidelines provided 
in this book to estimate your ACI• score at each stage of your preparation. 
WRITING TEST SCORING GUIDELINES 
The ACT Writing Test is scored on a 2-point through 12-point scale. Two profes- 
sional, trained readers will evaluate your answer, and each of them will assign a 
point value of I (worst) through 6 (best); the two scores are then totaled. If the 
two readers assign scores that differ by more than 1 point, then a 3rd reader will 
be called in to read your essay and make the final decision regarding your score. 
The scores are holistic scores, which means that your essay is judged as 
a whole without assigning point values to the specific characteristics that the

UNDERSTANDING THE ACT 
graders are looking for. Use the following guidelines when scoring your essays 
based on the sample prompts included in this book. 
Score of 6: The essay takes a clear position and discusses other perspectives, 
including perspectives that may differ from the author's. The essay is logical and 
complete. There are good transitions and very little or no irrelevant information. 
The introduction and conclusion am solid and consistent with each other and 
With the argument. The essay predicts and deals with counter arguments. While 
there mAy be a few errors, they are minor and infrequent. Grammar, spelling, 
and punctuation are nearly perfect. Vocabulary is effective and appropriate. 
Score of 5: The essay takes a clear position on the topic and might give an 
overall context. The essay deals with some of the complex issues surrounding the 
topic and at least raises some counter arguments. There are specific examples 
given. Organization is clear and concise even if it is not creative. Transition 
signals are used. The author uses language competently and there is some 
variation in word choice. Any errors present are relatively minor and not 
distracting. 
Score Of 4: The essay demonstrates an understanding Of the issue and the 
purpose of the essay is clear. The author states a position on the main issue and at 
least raises some potential counter arguments. There is adequate development 
of ideas and some specific reasons and/or examples are given. There is some 
logical sequence. Most transitions are simple. Them is some variety in sentence 
length and word choice. There are some distracting errors but the essay is still 
understandable. 
Score of 3: The essay reveals that the author has some understanding of 
the task. There is a clear position but no real overall context is provided. There 
may be some mention of counter arguments but they are cursory or not clearly 
stated. The essay may be repetitious or redundant. The essay Stays within 
the general subject but may stray from the specific issue. The organization 
is simple and predictable. Transitions, if any, are simple and predictable. 
Introduction and conclusion are present but not well developed. Word choice 
is generally appropriate and sentences lack variety in length or structure. There 
are distracting errors that impact understandability. 
Score of 2: The essay shows that the author misunderMood the assignment. 
There is no position taken on the main issue or there are no reasons given. 
There may be a general example or two but no specific examples offered. There 
are problems with the relevance of some of the statements made. Transition 
words may be incorrect or misleading. There are several distracting errors that 
affect the understandability of the essay. 
Score of 1: The author demonstrates almost no grasp of the assignmenL 
The essay fails to take a position or fails to support a position taken. May be 
excessively redundant. There is little or no structure or coherence. There are 
several errors that nearly prevent understanding the author's point, ir any. 
Score of O: The answer document is blank, the essay is on a topic of the 
author's own choosing, the essay is either completely or nearly illegible, or the 
essay is not written in English.

HUMAN TIES: passage is adopted from The 
Nature 01 Goodness by George Herbert palmer 
My reader mav well reel thal goodness is already

tering goodness, hoth laynæn and scholars are apt to 
tessume that it is altogether clear and requires no expla-

obscures. It breeds instincts and not understanding. So

30 to look into his own mind, see an whal ocx:asions Ive

it. Taking up a or the simplest possible examples, 
we will through them inquire when and why we call 
things good _ 
Here is a knife. When is it a good knife? Why, 
a knife is made for something. for cutting. Whenever

an adaptation realimed in its culling of the wood and in 
its conformity to the hand. Its goodness always has

And of what qualities or the day were we thinking? We

business and social duties would move rorwanl easily. 
In fact, whatever our plans, in calling the day a good 
day we meant to speak or it as excellently Xiapted to 
something outside Itself. 
A usage morc curious still occurs in the nursery. 
There when the question is asked, "Has the baby 
been gcxx_l?' one discovers hy degrees that the anx- 
ious mother wishes to know if it has been crying or 
quiet. •Ihis ek:menlary live has as yet not acquired

In short, whenever we inspect the usage of the 
word good, we always lind behind it an implication of

One or the main arguments the author is trying to make 
in the passage is Ihar 
A. good always connotes same ick•a no

DIRECTIONS: This test is designed to assess your writing skills. You have 30 minutes to plan and write 
an essay based on the stimulus provided. Be sure to take a position on the issue and support your 
position using logical reasoning and relevant examples. Organize your ideas in a focused and logical 
way, and use the English language to clearly and effectively express your position. 
When you have finished writing, refer to the Scoring Rubrics discussed in the Introduction (page 4) 
to estirnate your score. 
Foreign-language instruction is declining in public high 
schools in the United States. Some people think this reflects 
the rise of English as the accepted language of commerce 
around the world, and that knowledge of foreign languages 
is of lessening importance. Other people see the reduction 
in language study as a sign of the United States' failure to 
integrate with the rest of the world and a threat to the nation's 
vitality in an increasingly cross-cultural marketplace. 
In your opinion, should greater support be given to foreign 
language programs in high schools in the United States? 
In your essay, take a position on this question. You may write 
about one of the points of view mentioned above, or you 
may give another point of view on this issue. Use specific 
examples and reasons for your position.

ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS 
English Test Explanations 
PASSAGE 1 
l. The best answer is B. In this sentence, the word 
"obsessed" is most appropriate to descrihc the 
action taking place. •lhe word "ohsessive" can he 
used as an adjective. The participle "Obsessing" is 
not appropriate, and "ohsessioned" is not a word, 
so answer choices C and D can eliminated. 
2. The best answer is G. Answer choice G is the 
most clear and conciu•, because it simply uses the 
verb "pay." As it is written, the sentence is wordy 
and redundant. Answer choice H, ' 'paying money," 
sounds awkward and is grammatically incorrect 
in conjunction with the phrase that precedes it, 
"is willing to." Answer choice J is written in 
the past tense While the rest Of the sentence is 
written in the present tense and, therefore, must 
he eliminated. 
3. The best answer is C. Answer choice C is gram- 
Correct and makes Sense idiomatically. 
Answer choices A and B indicate that natural red- 
heads actually want to possess brunettes, which 
does not make sense Answer choice D does not 
make sense and is not correct ror standard written 
English. 
4. The best answer is J. The first part of the 
and the second part of the sentence arc independent 
clauses that refer to different hairstyles. Answer 
choice J, "and," makes most sense here. Answer 
choice "however," requires punctuation to fit in 
the sentence (normally between commas). Answer 
choice F implies that teenagers enjoy experimcält- 
ing With their hair as a result Of men and women 
cringing at the sight Of gray hair. Answer choices G 
and H imply that the two phrases negate each 
5. The best answer is A. The correct preposition to 
use here is "of. " The phrase "result of" is idiomatic. 
6. The best answer is G. This answer choice cor- 
reedy prcccdes the verb ' 'mixing" with its modifier 
"rapidly." 
7. The best answer is B. The sentence does not 
have a natural pause at this point in the sentence, 
so a comma is inappropriate. In addition, you can 
eliminate answer choices A and D. A colon should 
he used after a complete statement to introduce 
69 
directly related information, such as a list or an 
example, so answer choice C should he eliminated. 
8. 
The best answer is J. The word ' 'was" makes the 
most sen.q: in the w•nlencc, because it clearly and 
simply indicates the past tense. The phrase "could 
Of Can never Correct. Of is 
not appropriate in standard written English. Some 
use Off When they Should 
use "could've," which is the contraction Of "could 
have." 
9. The best answer is B. sentence is commjscd 
or a main clause ('The monthly highlighting went 
well") followed by a stmrdinator ("except for"), 
then an extended noun phrase ("those times when 
my hair turned out a little too subdued, making 
me look partially gray instead of brunette."). ESKR- 
cially as it is preceded by a subordinator. such a 
lengthy cornvxment Of sentence calls to be offset 
by a comma. 
10. 
The best answer is F. The sentence as it is writ- 
len makes the most .wnse in context. It sufficiently 
indicates that, despite some setbacks, the author's 
exvx.•rience With highlights has been mostly persi- 
tivc_ Answer choice G implies that the author was 
making some sort of list regarding her and her 
feelings towards her highlights. Answer choice H 
indicates some sort of contrast that is simply not 
present in the paragraph. Answer choice J sug- 
gests that the hairdresser's mistakes pleused the 
author. 
II. The best answer is D. Sentence 5 follows from 
the information in Sentence 3. Likewise, Sen- 
lencc 4 relics on Sentence 5, and also creates a 
good transition into the next paragraph. 
12. 
The best answer is J. TO maintain parallel tense 
in the sentence, since Donna "was" at 
the author's request, the simple past tense or the 
verb "gather" also needs to hc used. The sentence 
is written in the presænt tense; therefore answer 
choice F can be eliminated. Answer choices G 
and H are not in the parallel tense. 
13. 
The best answer is A. The coordinating con- 
junction ' 'and" is the most concise choice; it 
joins two functionally parallel elements within the 

****** Result for Image/Page 82 ******
70 
sentence—here, two nouns: "tears" and "laugh- 
ter." The phrases "along With" and "as well as" 
serve a similar function to the coordinating con- 
junction "and," but they arc awkward and neither 
clear nor concise. Answer choice C is incorrect 
fxcause "or" does not make sense in this context 
with "seesawing." 
14. The best answer is G. Since the preceding sen- 
tcnce does not summarin the essay or relate to 
the introduction, answer choices F and H can 
eliminated. •Illis sentence is svw•cilically about the 
narrator ceasing her crying, Which is not the pur- 
pose Of the essay. Eliminate answer choice J. The 
realization Of her vanity puls her situation in per- 
spective•, therefore, answer choice G is the best 
15. The best answer is C. The passage simply dis- 
cusses the narrator's exlNricnces in dyeing her 
own hair. It is unlikely that the author's decision 
to change her hair color would ease the appre- 
hension of others who were considering dyeing 
their hair. The fact that dyeing her hair gave 
her a bald spot would probably deepen the fears 
of those who were feeling anxious about dye- 
ing their hair. Eliminate answer choice A. Answer 
choice B can also be eliminated; the passage only 
discusses the author and Other "mature" women 
dyeing their hair. Answer choice D is incorrect 
the passage as a Whole is neutral and 
not attempt to influence people regarding changing 
hair color. 
PASSAGE II 
16. The best answer G. Answer choice G is a com- 
mon phrase, and sounds the hcst in the context of 
this sentence. It is appropriate to "American" 
as an adjective 10 describe the noun "heritage." The 
Other answer choices are grammatically incorrect. 
Also, answer choice J suggests that the "heritage" 
IVIongs to only one "American," which does not 
lit the context Of the paragraph. 
17. The best answer is A. TO state that Walker 
Lee "still practices" is clear and concise. Answer 
choices B and C are wordy and redundant in 
saying that "still continues to practice" and 
"continues to still practice." Answer choice D is 
18. The best a'"wer is J. This is written in 
the past tense. "Began" is the simple past form 
Of the verb "IN-•gin," therefore answer choice J is 
correct. Answer choice F is written in the past 
rx•rfect teruæ, and therefore does not maintain the 
PRACTICE TEST 1 ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS 
parallel between verbs. Answer choices G and II 
use "Ex.•gun," the past participle or "Ixgin," and 
can therefore he eliminated. 
19. The best answer is B. The phrase "that Fæing iron" 
does not make The rest of the answer choices 
correctly use parentheses or commas in setting off 
their respective appositive phrases. 
20. 
The best answer is F. The word "lugging" is 
the most descriptive word. It signifies carrying or 
pulling something heavy. Nonc of the other answer 
choices addrc»sses the effort it took to move the 
anvil from Pennsylvania to Michigan. 
21. The best answer is A. The phrase "get started" in 
answer Choice A Clearly indicates that Lee Was just 
beginning his career in blacksmithing. The Olher 
answer choices suggest that his career had already 
started. 
22. 
The best answer is F. In the context or the 
sentence, "its" is in the possessive Corm; there- 
fore, no amjstrophc is necessary "It's" means "it 
is." "Its"' (note the apostrophe at the end) does 
not exist in beacuse "it" is a singular 
23. 
The best answer is D. Omitting the underlined 
portion Of the sentence is the best choice in 
this instance. In any form, the information pro- 
vided in this sentence is distractive—not related 
to the main topic of the essay—and is therefore 
unnecessary. 
24. 
The best answer is F. Answer choice F provides 
a logical and relevant introduction to the topic 
or the paragraph Answer choice H is incorrect 
because the paragraphs preceding and following 
this sentence have nothing to do with moving 
equipment. Answer choices G and J can be elimi- 
nated hecause neither has anything to do with the 
construction of Lee's first blacksmith shop, the 
subject of the paragraph. 
25. The best answer is B. •Illis answer choice 
is correct it is the only one that is 
grammatically proper and makes Answer 
choice A does not make sense hecause "but" 
is used to introduce a contradictory elernent; 
a "crude" structure standing "only nine years" 
aprx:ars to he instead a correlational relationship. 
Answer choice C is ungrammatical and D violates 
agreement with "was." 
26. 
The best answer is F. two adjectives modify a 
noun in the same way, they must cither be separated 
by a comma or joined with the word "and" with no 

****** Result for Image/Page 83 ******
PRACTICE TEST 1 ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS 
27. The best answer is D. The phrase "at a family 
event" is a descriptive phra.w that must be set 
Off by commas. Answer choice C is incorrect 
because subject and verb must not separated 
by a comma. Similarly, in B, a comma makes an 
incorrect division or a compound. 
28. The best answer is G. •lhe act Of proclaiming took 
place during the event, so it is a completed action 
and should hc in the past tense. 
29. The best answer is A. The information given in 
Sentence 2 merely describes the knife from the pæ- 
ceding sentence, and has nothing to do with the 
creation or Lee's first objcct_ 
30. The best answer is E NO srx•cific person or 
point in time is mentioned, and the remainder 
Of the sentence is Written in the present tense. 
Thus, the prey-ent tense Of the verb "watch" must 
PASSAGE Ill 
31. The best answer is D. Using the past tense verb 
"lvgan" makes the most sense because the narra- 
tor is recalling What happened When she heard the 
32. The best answer is F. Answer choice F correctly 
places a comma following the clause that begins 
with the stmrdinator ' 'As," which descritvs 
What happened that caused the narrator's eyes 
to pop out Of her head and her jaw to drop. 
Answer choice G creates a run-on sentence. 
Answer choices H and J incorrectly place com- 
mas following the word "could," which creates 
awkward and ungrammatical sentences. 
33. The best answer is A. An easy way to figure 
out the answer to this question is to look at [he 
preceding sentence. In that sentence, the narra- 
tor says, "I could." To maintain verb parallelism 
in the paragraph, the phrase "I could" should be 
repeated. 
34. The best answer is II. In this sentencæ, the word 
"that" is unnecessary, because the nonnal clause- 
introducing function of the word "that" is satisfied 
by "how." Answer choice G is wrong because 
"because" does not make sense after "about." 
Answer choice J lacks a clause-introducer. 
35. The best answer is A. •Illis question tests your 
ability 10 maintain parallel Structure in a sentence. 
Each verb in the sequence or events is Written in the 
past tense. Since the sister's husband "threw hack 
the bedcovers" and "began heating the dreaded 
71 
thing With a broom," he would have to have 
"flushe'T' it down the toilet. 
36. 
The best answer is F. This part or the sentence 
requites a verb, so you can eliminate answer 
choice J _ The adjective "deadly" is used to describe 
the scorpions If the word "deadlier" is uu•d, the 
word "more" cannot precede it; therefore, answer 
choice G can hc eliminated. The comma before 
"and" indicates the phrase preceding it must 
an independent clause, meaning one that con- 
tains a verb phrase that could stand alone in 
a sentence. The gerund ("-ing") form violates 
this test. 
37. The best answer is A. This answer choice gives a 
logical explanation ror Why Diana would not seek 
professional help as the condition Of her arm con- 
tinued to worsen. The remaining choices are not 
supported by the context. 
38. 
The best answer is J. This question tests your abil- 
ily to express yourself clearly and simply. Because 
the sentence states that worpions Will sting any- 
one they accidentally encounter, using the word 
"inadvertently" would hc redundant and unneces- 
sary. The word "crawl" is the clearest and 
concise choice. 
39. 
The best answer is D. This question tests your 
ability to accurately create the possessive form of 
words. In this case, the narrator is talking about 
the homes of many scorpions instead of the home 
Of one specific scorpion. The plural possessive 
form Of scorpion, "scorpions'." must be used. TO 
make a plural word possessive. you must place an 
apostrophe aner the pluralizing 
40. 
The best answer is F. Answer choice G is awkward 
hecause its components are not written in logical 
order. Answer choice II places an unnecessary 
comma after the word "species." Answer choice J 
is ambiguous as to whether the ' 'ninety species" in 
question constitute all the world's scorpions or just 
those native to the United States. 
41. 
The best answer is B. In this part or the sentence, 
the word "which" introduces a clause descriptive 
of the noun that precedes it, "the Bark Scorpion." 
42. 
The best answer is H. This question tests your 
ability to discern which details are important to the 
subject of an In this ease, the author prewi- 
ously mentioned that scorpions can found in the 
home, and it is obvious that they still live outside. 
The underlined portion reinforcc»s the notion that 
scorpions can he found both inside the home and 
outside the horne.

43. The best answer is A. This sentence follows a 
standard verb pattern ror hypothetical situations. 
Ex.•gins a clause in simple present tense, which 
precedes a clause in the imperative (command) 
form For example, "If you swim today, apply 
44. The best answer is J. This question requires you 
to put things in logical order, and to decide whether 
the underlined portion is relevant to the paragraph. 
In this case, it is best to omit the underlined portion 
txcause it not add any information 
to the paragraph; it is an irrelevant detail. The rest 
Of the sentences are already in the most logical 
45. The best answer is C. Answer choices A and B 
can be eliminated immediately because the sim- 
ple answer to the question is no. This essay does 
not provide professional advice on the treatment Of 
scorpion stings. The essay is merely a recollection 
of a time when the narrator's sister was stung by a 
scorpion and the narrator is offering advice based 
solely on INrsonal experience and opinion. 
PASSAGE IV 
46. The best answer is J. Answer choice F is incorrect 
dashes Should only he used 10 place 
emphasis on a certain word or phrase in a sen- 
tence, which is unnecessary here. Answer choice G 
is incorrect the preceding phrase is not an 
independent clause, thus must not separated by 
a semicolon. Answer choice H is incorrect because 
it creates a run-on sentence Answer choice J cor- 
rectly identifies the fact that the word ' 'if" begins a 
clause that must he separated from the rest of the 
sentence by a comma wherever the clause ends. 
In this the second clause clearly lx•gins With 
revvtition Of the subject "you." 
47. The best answer is A. •Illis is the most clear and 
conciw• answer choice. •lhe Others are awhvard. 
Answer choice C is incorrect tx•cause "always" 
modifies '%ccompany" and must, in this case, pre- 
cede it. Answer choice D dcx•s not include the word 
"always," which causes the sentence to lose a key 
48. The best answer is G. "Non-compliance" 
describes the wrong each side fccls the other com- 
milted, thus the lawsuits assert "non-compliance 
on both sides." This eliminates all answer choices 
except answer choice G 
49. The best answer is A. Answer choice B uses 
an unnecessary comma. Answer choices C and D 
PRACTICE TEST 1 ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS 
can be eliminated they are incorrect as 
idiomatic phrases. 
50. 
The best answer is H. In this case, the word 
"promised" is used as an adjective. Illus, answer 
choices F and G can be eliminated. Answer choice J 
is an adjective, but the definitions or "promised" 
and "promising" differ. reward was assured, 
or promised, to Helga. It was not likely to develop 
nor did it show potential, both aspects of the deli- 
nition of "promising," thus answer choice J can be 
el iminated. 
Sl. The best answer is A. Answer choice B creates an 
incomplete sentence, so it can be eliminated. Since 
the action was continuously owurring in the past, 
you would say that she "had heen living." 
52. 
The best answer is H. Answer choice J can 
be eliminated because the underlined portion is 
preceded by the article The article "the" 
must precede the word "greatest." Since "reward" 
serves correctly as a noun in this sentence, answer 
choices F and G can eliminated. A "great 
reward," answer choice H, is the best and most 
53. 
The best a'"wer is D. Sentence I explains how 
Helga became interested in the contest, so it 
must hc first. Vlhis eliminates answer choice C. 
It makes w•nsc that the requirements would be 
listed next and thal the comments about the bicycle 
Skirl would follow. The last Sentence, Sentence 4, 
explains Why Helga decided to make the journey 
despite the embarrassment Of wearing a bicycle 
54. 
The best answer is H. The actions ofHelga and her 
daughter should be written in [he simple past tense 
in order to maintain verb parallelism throughout the 
paragraph. Answer choice J is in the past tense, but 
it is wordy. "Have," in any form, is not newssary 
to this phrwse. 
SS. The best answer is A. •Illis answer choice is the 
clearest and most concise. The Other choices are 
wordy and awkward. 
56. 
The best answer is J. "Nowhere to be found" is a 
common idiomatic phrase, making it the most clear 
and concise choice. The Other answer choices are 
awkward. 
57. The best answer is B. Answer choice A indicates 
that the following sentence is a result or what 
comes fx•fore In this case, the phrases not 
causally connected, so answer choice A is incorrect. 
Answer choice C is awkward and answer choice D 
is wordy. The phrase 'fin fact" is not newssary to 

****** Result for Image/Page 85 ******
PRACTICE TEST 1 ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS 
this passage. Answer choice B is the clearest and 
most concise choice. 
58. The best answer is F. The words "leaving only" 
begin a descriptive clauu•, which must hc set off 
by a comma. Answer choice G creates a run-on 
sentence. Semicolons must be used to separate two 
independent clauses; therefore, answer choice H 
is incorrect. Answer choice J uses a comma 
incorrectly, separating "only" from the phrase it 
modilics. 
59. The best answer is A. Answer choice A gives a 
cilic reason as 10 What Helga intended to use the 
$10,000 prin for. passage clearly stales that 
without this prize money, the F—stby farm would 
race foreclosure. Answer choice B simply restates 
the fact that Helen wanted the $10,000 she would 
Win if she completed the cross-country walk, but 
does not explain what she would use the money 
ror- Answer choice C is incorrect because no logical 
connection between the prin money and the chil- 
dren's diphtheria is made in the passage Answer 
choice D is outside the scovx of the as well; 
there is no mention of Clara gaining experience 
anywhere in the passage. 
60. The best answer is J. Answer choices F and 
G are incorrect the Writer should not 
make this addition 10 the passage; it is irrelevant. 
Answer choice H identifies an unimportant detail 
Of the great-great-grandson's Story as the reason 
the sentence does not EXIong. 
PASSAGE V 
61. The best answer D. Apmjsitives, like "partic- 
ularly via airplane," must separated from the 
sentence by commas. They are easily identified 
hccause they can be omitted from the sentence 
without rendering the sentence ungrammatical. 
62. The best answer is G. Because the author wishes 
to add more detail, the best answer choice Will he 
the one that includes the most descriptive language. 
Answer G is the hest alternative because it includes 
the explanatory detail "also known as jet lag" and 
correctly sets it apart With commas. 
63. The best answer is A. The sentence identifies 
jet lag as a "sleeping disorder," but the word 
"although" indicates that what follows arc mitigat- 
ing factors. First, jet lag is a "temporary condition" 
and second, jet lag is "not as serious" as other 
sleeping disorders. Answer choice B apvwars to 
deline correctly the lack of seriousness, but is 
missing the critical first "as" to make a comparison.

The best answer is J. Before a term is defined, its 
relevance 10 the passage must he Stated. 
more, among the other answer choices, circadian 
rhythms are not slxcilically mentioned. 
65. 
The best answer is C. While the sentence as it is 
written may grammatical, its use of punctuation 
is excessive. Answer choice C provides a fluid, con- 
cisc transition to the details of the human "sleeping 
and waking" cycle. 
66. 
The best answer is J. This sentence elaborates 
on the statement the previous sentence by 
citing an example. It does not provide supple- 
mentary (Answer choice F: "In addition"), parallel 
(G: "Likewise"), or opposing (H: "Instead") evi- 
dencc. 
67. 
The best answer is B. It is appropriate to use the 
plural possessive pronoun "our" when referring to 
the inner clocks of human twings. 
68. 
The best answer is J. •lhe sentence introduces 
a factor adversely affecting circadian rhythms, 
which does not require additional transition words. 
Answer choices F and II create incomplete sen- 
69. The best atBwer is B. "Well-tuned" stands by 
itself as a satisfactory idiomatic expression mean- 
ing "optimized." Introducing "high" or "highly" 
makes the sentence unnecessarily wordy. 
70. The best answer is F. Answer choices G and H 
may eliminated ror their wordiness. Answer 
Choice J may because it makes 
strong an assertion about the link between long air 
travel and headaches. Answer choice F correctly 
uses "Often" to define the frequency of passengers' 
headaches _ 
71. 
The best answer is D. As it is written in the 
passage, this verb phrase is wordy, as it is writ- 
ten in pwssive voice ("being"). This same prin- 
ciple eliminates answer choice B. Answer choice 
C may be eliminated for its unnecessary use Of 
72. 
The best answer is G. When adjectives modify 
a noun in a similar way, they are separated from 
each other with commas or "and," just as in a list. 
there must be a comma between "dry" 
and "pressurind_" It is not necessary to include 
a comma after ' 'pressurized," it is fol- 
lowed directly by the noun that is being modified 
(atmosphere). 
73. 
The best answer is D. Using a comma to join inde- 
pendent clauses creates a comma splice. The Other

Choices present Ways to 
independent clauses. 
74. The best answer is H. This answer choice 
mentions the body's "new environment." Logical 
places for the sentence, thus, would be after the 
technique cited for acclimating to eastbound trawl 
(before Sentence 4) and after the technique cited for 
acclimating to westbound travel (after Sentence 5).

The best answer is A. This sentence would 
provide a reason why understanding ways to

PASSAGE 1 
l. The best answer is B. The passage takes place on 
a ship, the Nellie, and the narrator is one of the 
crew members. He uses words like "we" and "us" 
when referring to the crew, implying his memtx:r- 
ship to this group. The other answer choices arc not 
supported by the passage. 
2. The best answer is F. Although the passage states, 
"for some reason Or another we did not hcgin that 
game or dominoes," it is reasonable to assume that 
it was because they were too tired from the use 
Of the words "lazily" and "meditative." The Other 
answer choices are not supported hy the passage. 
3. The best answer is C. The passage states that "the 
Lawyer . had, because or his many years and 
many virtues, the only cushion on deck," indi- 
eating that since he was the eldest crew member 
and had the other crew members' respect, he was 
afforded the comfort of the cushion. The other 
answer choices are not supported by the passage. 
4. The best answer is F. The definition of "placid" is 
"not exsily excited or upset; calm." Since the men 
on the ship were rcwling "meditative" and seemed 
not to have an abundance Of energy, it makes sense 
that they simply wanted to sit calmly. •lhe Other 
answer Choices are not the Context Of 
the passage. 
5. The best answer is D. In the fifth paragraph the 
narrator is describing how Marlow is unlike most 
sailors: 'The yarns of seamen have a direct sim- 
plicity, the whole meaning of which lies within the 
shell of a cracked nut. But Marlow was not typi- 
cal and to him the meaning of an episode was 
not inside like a kernel but outside This is to 
say that typical sailors tell simple, uncomplicated 
tales, while Marlow tends to tell stories that are 
layered and complex. This best supports answer 
choice D. 
6. The best answer is II. Since Marlow States that 
the episode Which he is about to 
sornehow throw a light on everything about (him)," 
We Can this had a profound 
effect on him. other answer choices are either 
not supported by the passage or are the 
scope of the passage. 
7. The best atBwer is A. The passage states that, 
Director of Companies was our captain and our 
host. We four affectionately watched his back as 
he stood in the bow looking toward the sea. On the 
83 
whole river there was nothing that looked half so 
nautical. He resembled a pilot, which to a seaman 
is trustworthiness personified." This best supports 
answer choice A. 
8. 
The best answer is G. •lhere are clues in the pas- 
sage to indicate thal the narrator, as well as the other 
crew members, were not thrilled When Marlow 
began to speak. Marlouøs very first comment was 
"accepted in silence" and "no one took the trouble 
to grunt even." In the next paragraph the narrator 
begins to realize that the crew was "'rated, 
the ebb began to run, to hear about one of Marlow's 
inconclusive experiences." Since resigned means 
"accepting that something can not be avoided" and 
tolerance means "patience," making G the best 
an swer. 
9. The best answer is A. In the third paragraph the 
passage slates that the men's mutual interest in 
the sca created a bond between them capable of 
"holding (their) hearts together through long peri- 
ods or separation," "making (them) tolerant of 
each other's yarns," and making them accepting 
of each other's "convictions." Answer choice A is 
not mentioned in the 
10. The best answer is J. passage States that the 
crewmen watched him "affectionately," meaning 
"showing rondness or liking." The captain is also 
described as "trustworthiness personified," indicat- 
ing that the other crew members have the utmost 
faith and trust in him. This best supports answer 
choice J. 
PASSAGE II 
II. The best answer is B. As stated in the passage, 
"in the past 30 years, known supplies have dwin- 
died from 300 TCF to around 150 TCF," 
or known supplies have decreased by about 
50 percent. Answer choice A is incorrect twcause 
the passage States that at predicted rates Of con- 
sumption, the United Stales' natural gas supply 
would be exhausted in approximately live years. 
Answer choice C is incorrect because natural gas 
provides ror roughly 25 percent Of America's 
energy needs, which has nothing to do With the 
decrease in supply. Answer choice D is incorrect 
because the passage states that it is extrernely diffi- 
cult to obtain natural gas from other countries, not 
from within the US. 

****** Result for Image/Page 96 ******
12. The best answer is G. At the end Of the passage, 
the author states that "consumers and business 
leaders should not rely on liquid natural gas to 
solve America's energy nccds_" can also 
inferred from the point that natural gas is currently 
only supplying approximately 25 perecnt of the 
nation's energy needs, and even at this level there 
is much concern over whether supplies will run ouL 
Answer choice H may appear to he correct, hut the 
pawsage merely states that countries such as Japan 
and China will also hc searching for fuel sources, 
including liquid natural gas, outside or their own 
countries in the future. 
13. The best answer D. This question can diffi- 
cult if you do not read the answer choices carefully. 
The third paragraph is devoted to a discussion 
on the limited availability of liquid natural gas, 
and the expenw of procc«ng the gas, which 
makes answer choice D the twst selection. Answer 
choice A may appear 10 correct; however. the 
passage focuses the supply and Of liquid 
natural gas around the world. •lhe passage does 
not discuss the supply and use Of any Other energy 
sources. Answer choice B was mentioned briefly in 
the passage, but is not a main idea. Answer choice 
C is beyond the scope or the passage. 
14. The best answer is F. As stated in the second 
paragraph, it is predicted that "liquid natural gas 
imports Will increase hy almost 5(K) percent in a 
few short years." Although America may reluc- 
tant to import liquid natural gas. it is necessary 
for the nation to do so in order to relieve and/or 
avoid shortages. Answer choice II may appear to 
Correct; however, the author States that even 
though transportation costs have heen substantially 
decreased due to new technology, importing liquid 
natural gas "is still often uneconomical." Answer 
choices G and J arc Fæyond the scope or the 
passage. 
IS. The best answer is C. According to the passage, 
"Currently, Canada is the largest liquid natural gas 
supplier ror the United Stales." Japan and China, 
two countries in Asia, are providing cornrNtition in 
attaining liquid natural gas 
16. The best answer is F. The first sentence Of the third 
passage stales 'One Of the largest misconceptions 
about liquid natural gas is that it is an abundant 
source Of natural gas." While the passage gck.•s on 
to discuss the expense of creating new process- 
ing facilities and prices making liquid natural gas 
uneconomical, the only misconception mentioned 
is the fact that liquid natural gas is an abundant

source Of natural gas. Other answer choices are 
not supported hy the passage. 
17. The best answer is C. The context surrounding the 
word phenomenal discusses the surprisingly large 
growth exvx•cled in natural gas demand and the 
huge impact that such growth will have on deple- 
lion or the resource. This context clearly indicates 
that the demand is increasing at or 
extraordinary, rates. other answer choices are 
not supported by the context or the passage 
18. 
The best answer is G. Answer choice G is the 
only reason that Arnerica is choosing liquid natu- 
ral gas; consumers arc demanding it so America 
must provide it. Answer choices F and H express 
curænt problems with choosing liquid natural gas; 
transportation and processing arc both very costly 
relative to other fuel sources. Answer choice J is a 
potential problem. Liquid natural gas is inherently 
expensive due to its transportation and processing 
costs. natural gas prices are the market 
for liquid natural gas Will plummet, making liquid 
natural gas an uneconomical choice for consumers. 
19. The best answer is D. As stated in the paragraph, 
"natural gas demand is increasing at phenomenal 
rates" and its consumption is cxvx•cled to grow from 
22 trillion cubic per year 10 32 trillion cubic 
reel year in less than a decade. Answer choice C 
may appear to correct; however. the passage 
simply states that Canada is the largest liquid nat- 
ural gas supplier ror the United States alone. The 
passage not compare liquid natural 
gas exports to those of any other country; there- 
fore, we do not knm,v whether or not Canada is the 
world 's largest exporter. Likewise, the other answer 
choices not supported by the passage. 
20. 
The best answer is J. In the paragraph, the vessel 
in question is descriful as something that the liquid 
natural gas is injected into for transportation. It 
does not make sense that a liquid would injected 
into a "process," "source," or "facility" for trans- 
portation. Answer choice J, "container," is the most 
logical choice. 
PASSAGE 111 
21. The best answer is B. Throughout the passage, 
the author talks the prevalence Of the word 
"good," further discusses several different mean- 
ings and methods for interpreting the word, and

babies are so young and powerless ("this elemen- 
lary life has not yet acquired positive standards 
or measurement"), that they can only hc judged 
in negative terms, "a failure to disturb." Answer 
choice G may appear to hc cortect; however, the 
"anxious mother" is still able to judge whether her 
baby has been good by what the baby did or did 
not do—in this case, cry. 
23. The best answer is A. The author states that "we 
employ the word or some synonym or it dur- 
ing pretty much every waking hour or our lives. 
Wishing some test or this frequency. I turned 
to Shakespeare." In simpler terms, the author is 
asserting that we use the word "gcx»d" or some 
form or it constantly, and he helieved that the works 
Of Shakespeare would provide a good test or this 
notion. In Other words, if Shakespeare used forms 
of the word "good" as often as the author predicted, 
the author's theory on use or the word would he 
proven true. This best supports answer choice 
24. The best answer is H. The author writes "goodness 
always has reference to something outside itself, 
and is measured by its performance of an external 
task." The author goes on to write, 'The knife is 
good for cutting and the day ror business ... TO he 
bad Or good implies external reference." •Illis lx•st 
supports answer choice H. 
25. The best answer is D. The author describes a quote 
by Shakespeare 's Portia as heing spoken "lucidly," 
and goes on to analyze and apply Portia's quota- 
lion. The author does so in a pcsitive light, thus 
eliminating answer choices A and B. It does not 
make wnse that Portia's quote was "enthusiastic," 
or excitcd_ Answer choice D makes the most 
within the context of the passage; "coherently" 
means "logically and meaningfully." 
26. The best answer is H. When discussing the knife, 
the author states, ' 'Its goodness always hws ref- 
erence to something outside itself." Although the 
passage mentions cutting wood, the author never 
says that a knife is good only if it cuts wood. 
Answer Choices G and J are not supported by the 
context Of the passage. 
27. The best answer is A. author begins by 
discussing the goodness or a clear, tangible 
object—a knife. The author then moves on to dis- 
cussing the gexjdncss or the weather—something 
"not so palpable " Answer choice A, "apparent." 
makes the most sense. The goodness of an intan- 
gible thing, such as the weather, is not nearly 
as "evident or clear" as that of a tangible objecL 
85 
goodness or the weather is not less "compli- 
caled" than that or the knife; likewise, it does not 
make sense that the goodness Of the weather would 
be less "mjwerful" or "drab" than that of the knife. 
28. 
The best answer is J. The author states, "We must 
have some respect Or end in mind in reference 10 
Which the goodness is compared." In Other words, 
in order to understand What "good" means, you 
must know What is being referred to as 
"grx»d" hefore interpreting the definition or "good." 
Answer Choice G may appear to be Correct, but 
the passage states that "good always means good 
'for;'" thereby asserting that the two are actually 
identical concepts. 
29. The best answer is D. •Ihroughout the passage 
the author refers to the actual application or 
word "good," and that the word "must hc use- 
ful for something." This best supports answer 
Choice D. 
30. 
The best answer is G. According to the author, 
goodness in life "attends all our wishes, acts, and 
projects as nothing else does, so that no estimate 
of its influence can excessive." author fur- 
thers this point by adding that every action we 
lake is in hovx•s Of achieving something good. In 
simpler terms, the author is saying that 
our pursuit Of goodness has such a huge impact 
on our lives, there is no way we could overes- 
timate or over-emphasize the influence this has 
on us. Answer choice F is incorrect because it is 
the opposite or whal the author is trying to say.

as a planet, while Scientist 2 believes Pluto would 
be more accurately categorized as a Kuilxr Belt 
comet. This best supports answer choice J. 
7. 
The best answer is B. Scientist 2 explains that cur- 
rently two categorintions of planets exist: rocky 
and gaseous. The scientist then goes on to "Iy that 
Pluto not lit into cither of these categories

8. 
The best answer is E The questions asks for the 
identification Of the characteristic that does not dif- 
ferentiate Pluto from asteroids and comets. Neither 
Pluto nor asteroids and comets can generate heal 
through nuclear fission, so this is not a differen- 
Gating characteristic, making this answer choice 
the best. 
9. The best ansyer is B. Scientist 2 maintains that 
Pluto is not like the other planets due to its icy 
surface. If the ice melted and revealed that Pluto's 
surface was similar to Mars, Scientist 2's argument 
would be significantly weakened. 
10. The best answer is J. Both scientists mention the 
irregularity Of Pluto's orbit in their respective argu- 
ments. Scientist I states, "Pluto's Orbital path is 
irregular as cornpan•d with the other planets Of the 
solar system, and Scientist 2 also makes note Of the 
"eccentricity or Pluto's orbit." 
II. The best answer is A. One or the arguments that 
Scientist I makes for Pluto not Ixing a comet is 
that Pluto is rar too massive. If a comet were 
discovered with a diameter of 1,500 miles, it would 
be even larger than Pluto, which has a diameter of 
1,413 miles. This would nullify the scientist's argu- 
ment that Pluto cannot he a comet because comets 
are much smaller than Pluto. 
12. 
The best answer is II. One reason that Scicältist 2 
offers to support the argument ror Pluto to be

PRACTICE TEST 1 ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS 
21. The best answer is C. Since there is a direct, pos- 
itive relationship salt pan age and mineral 
volume, if a salt pan were to have firmed before the 
oldest salt pan in the study, then it would likely con- 
tain a greater volume or minerals than that pan is 
shown to contain _ Since the oldest pan in the study 
contained 12, cubic kilometers of minerals, 
a pan older than that would have a higher mineral 
value. 
22. 
The best answer is H. Since the ages of the fossils 
are stated in Study 2 to be similar to the ages of the 
saltpans, a fossil that is 9.7 million years Old would 
be closest in age to Salt pan C (10.8 million years 
Old) and. therefore, would most likely hc found in
